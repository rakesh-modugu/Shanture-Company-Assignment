# Shanture Company Assignment Reference Document

---

This guide is designed to help you complete the MERN Stack Developer Assignment for Shanture's Fresher Hiring Challenge. The goal is to build a Sales Analytics Dashboard that demonstrates your skills in working with data aggregation, processing, and modern UI development. While the original assignment emphasizes MongoDB for the database and aggregation pipelines, you have flexibility to use either MongoDB or a SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL) for the backend. The frontend should be built with React, and the backend with Node.js and Express.js.

## Assignment Overview

Build a dashboard that processes sales data, applies filters, and visualizes insights. Key features include:

- Date-range filtering.
- Data aggregation for metrics like total revenue, top products/customers, etc.
- Interactive charts and tables.
- Real-time updates (bonus).

Use modern tools:

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js.
- **Database**: MongoDB (preferred for aggregation pipelines) or SQL (e.g., via Sequelize or Knex for ORM).
